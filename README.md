[**简体中文**](./cn/README.md)

Forget Me Not, in short, FMN modpack, is a modpack that has been developed all by myself for over 1 year. It provides an immersive, breath-taking yet smooth experience. 

***
### **🎆Immersive**
I do care about immersion. Advancements are replaced by realtime ingame tips. Also, dark gui is applied on every gui for a seamless experience.
However, immersion is something related to so many designs, I can't list them all. 

***
### **⚖Well-balancing**
It has been tested for hours and hours to make sure it's balanced and stable. A dynamic difficulty system is designed for this modpack. You will face thougher enemies underground, in other dimension, and further away, some of them even have special abilities. 

***
### **🗡Challenging gameplay**
Well, that's something for sure. New AI and mechanics were added, making each fight enjoyable and rewarding. Dynamic difficulty system is introduced! When you switch your difficulty to easy, then it really is, providing you a light experience. But when it comes to hard, a hardcore adventure would be there for you! And of course, it becomes harder when you go deeper or further. 

***
### **🌿Vanilla+**
I know FMN has 200+ mods, but it's still providing you a vanilla+ experience. All of them are carefully configured to fit in each other and the style of this modpack. You will see hundreds of custom recipes, even the custom items, all for compability. 

***
### **🎨Minimalism style**
No tech, no complex things. No level-limited system, you get what you get. No backpacks, you don't need it cause I solved the inventory issue. No copper, yeah, screw it. 

***
### **🎵Music System**
Brand-new royalty-free musics are added for better experience, you can use them in your content or stream! 

***
### **⚡Performant**

_12 view distance, 5 similation distance, limited to 95 frames_. 

When max frames is set to "unlimited", I get 200+ frames on average. 

**Lowest ram required for a smooth gameplay: 2G**.

It is highly suggested to use higher versions of java.

<summary>Here are the jvm args for best performance: </summary>
**Allocates 6G by default, change xms and xmx to fit your own need**:
